      You probably know that I don't often make birthday cards using the abomination 
      that is HTML and format it suspiciously close to a multibillion dollar company's
      website that's in dire need of an update (even if you don't think so). 
      However, I have a thought regarding your personal life that probably won't save you
      real money (sorry &#128176;&#128550;).
      <br>
      <br>
      We've shared some pretty great memes--like 
      when we made Shir order Papa John's just to get a shit ton of dessert, 
      or every time we coaxed the 3410 TAs into feeding us worksheet answers because who actually
      learned course material until the day of the exam ~smh~. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Even though I'm disappointed that we never made a diss track, I'm really happy 
      I got to know you this past semester. You're SO frickin smart 
      (we should actually try pong sometime! It'll probably work first or second try &#128530;), 
      hardworking, and caring; you make everyone around you happier, and I'm really lucky 
      to have you as a friend &#128522;

      happy birthday boi &#127881;

      Hope your day is as amazing as catching a female pikachu and a male jigglypuff in wedlocke~ &#128519; :^)
