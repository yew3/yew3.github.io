      You probably know that I don't often use the abomination that is HTML to 
      make birthday cards and format them to look ~suspiciously~ similar 
      to a multibillion dollar company's outdated website. 
      However, I have a thought regarding your personal life that probably won't save you
      real money (sorry &#128176;&#128550;) (ok this is where I stop copying off the website lol).

      We've shared some pretty good memes--like 
      when we made Shir order Papa John's just to get a shit ton of dessert, 
      or every time we coaxed the 3410 TAs into feeding us worksheet answers (because who actually
      learned course material until the day of the exam smh). 
      <br>
      <br>
      Even though I'm disappointed that we never made a diss track, I'm really happy 
      I got to know you this past semester. You're SO frickin smart 
      (wait we should actually try pong sometime--it'll probably work first or second try &#128530;), 
      hardworking, and caring; you make everyone around you happier, and I'm really lucky 
      to have you as a friend &#128522;

      happy birthday boi &#127881;

      Hope your day is as amazing as catching a female pikachu and a male jigglypuff in wedlocke~ &#128519;
